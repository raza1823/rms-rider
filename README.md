Revenue Management System

Rider Mobile App 

Scope of the project: 
1. Login screen with national identity and password authentication. 
2. Dashboard screen with rider progress, pending cases component & rider status. 
3. Cases screen with assign cases, pending cases tabs. 
4. Case detail screen with case information, status, comments & case history, also have 
options to mark case as pending or complete. 

Challenging phase for me regarding this project, I developed this app contains screens 
correct navigation, google map, QR Scanner, auto refresh case list, comments and history & 
refresh rider status and its location. Also fix UI elements responsiveness according to iOS or 
android and use async await method to fetch APIs and connect application with project 
backend.
